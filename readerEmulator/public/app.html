      These are words. Here are some more words. Everything is words. Mostly these are test words. Some will be used for the spelling activity. Words like:
      <ul>
        <li>Put the <a id='grease' style='background-color: yellow'>grease</a> on the axle</li>
        <li>Are <a id='these' style='background-color: yellow'>these</a> strawberries freshly picked?</li>
        <li>Would you like a <a id='piece' style='background-color: yellow'>piece</a> of pie?</li>
        <li>It <a id='seem' style='background-color: yellow'>seems</a> like today will be a good day.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>In 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of Cincinnati, Ohio, lay a huge and almost endless forest.</p>
<p><span>The area had a few settlements established by <a id="people" style='background-color: yellow'>people</a> of the frontier</span>. Many of them had already left the area for settlements further to the west. But among those remaining was a man who had been one of the first people to arrive there.</p>
<p>He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest. <span>He <a id='seemed'style='background-color: yellow'>seemed</a> a part of the darkness and silence of the forest</span>, <span>for no one had ever known him to smile or <a id='speak' style='background-color: yellow'>speak</a> an unnecessary word</span>. His simple needs were supplied by selling or trading the skins of wild animals in the town.</p>
<p>His little log house had a single door. Directly opposite was a window. The window was boarded up. <span>No one could <a id='remember' style='background-color: yellow'>remember</a> a time when it was not</span>. And no one knew why it had been closed. I imagine there are few people living today who ever knew the secret of that window. But I am one, as you shall see.
