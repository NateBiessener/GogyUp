      These are words. Here are some more words. Everything is words. Mostly these are test words. Some will be used for the spelling activity. Words like:
      <ul>
        <li>Put the <a id='grease' style='background-color: yellow'>grease</a> on the axle</li>
        <li>Are <a id='these' style='background-color: yellow'>these</a> strawberries freshly picked?</li>
        <li>Would you like a <a id='piece' style='background-color: yellow'>piece</a> of pie?</li>
        <li>It <a id='seem' style='background-color: yellow'>seems</a> like today will be a good day.</li>
      </ul>
    </p> -->
    <p>In 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of Cincinnati, Ohio, lay a <a id="huge" style='background-color: yellow'>huge</a> and almost endless forest.</p>
<p>The area had a few settlements established by people of the frontier. Many of them had already left the area for settlements further to the west. <span>But among those remaining was a man who had been one of the first people to <a id='arrive'style='background-color: yellow'>arrive</a> there.</span></p>
<p><span>He lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the <a id='great' style='background-color: yellow'>great</a> forest.</span> He seemed a part of the darkness and silence of the forest, for no one had ever known him to smile or speak an unnecessary word. His simple needs were supplied by selling or trading the skins of wild animals in the town.</p>
<p>His little log house had a single door. Directly opposite was a window. The window was boarded up. No one could remember a time when it was not. <span>And no one <a id='knew' style='background-color: yellow'>knew</a> why it had been closed.</span> I imagine there are few people living today who ever knew the secret of that window. But I am one, as you shall see.
